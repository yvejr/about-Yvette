</h2>

<i>Besides being interested in tech and web development, I like keeping up with my veggie garden (a tomato forest, last year), baking cakes, fermenting food, and trying craft beers.
    <ul>
        I love...
            <li>Road Trips</li>
            <li>Hiking</l>
            <li>Camping</li>
        <p>Traveling is the best; most recently I visited Iceland in the winter for my honeymoon.
    I do a lot of photography whenever on trips.
        My favorite thing to do is experience and learn new things. I have some pretty varied interests.</i>
