<p>
    Hi, my name is Yvette. I'm an <abbr title="New Mexico, USA">NM</abbr> with no plans to leave the Land of Enchantment. In December of last year, I married my favorite person in the world, John.
    We have 2 furry- four legged children and 4 feathery chickens.
</p>
<p>I was unsatisfied with my career for a long time. I chose programming for my new career so that I will never be bored again! I was really inspired by people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjy2jCO-VXE">Valente</a> who made drastic but successful career changes.
