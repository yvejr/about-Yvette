    The Basics
</h2>
<p>
    Hi, my name is Yvette. I'm an NM native and here to stay. I was married in December to my favorite person in the world, John. We have 2 furry- four legged children and 4 feathery chickens.

<h2>
    Stuff I Enjoy
</h2>
<p>
    Besides being interested in tech and web development, I like keeping up with my veggie garden (a tomato forest, last year), baking cakes, fermenting food, and trying craft beers.
    I love road trips, hiking, and camping. Traveling is the best; most recently I visited Iceland in the winter for my honeymoon.
    I do a lot of photography whenever on trips.
    My favorite thing to do is experience and learn new things. I have some pretty varied interests.

    I am happy to help peers however I can, knowing that I will lean on them often. Let's have an awesome 10 weeks!
